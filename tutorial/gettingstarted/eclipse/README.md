# Getting Started with Micro Focus Enterprise Developer for Eclipse (Windows)

## Overview
This set of tutorials guides you through the use of Micro Focus Enterprise Developer for Eclipse. They provide a basic understanding of how the product operates.

These tutorials are designed for developers who have experience with developing COBOL on the mainframe but do not necessarily have a working knowledge of the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The tutorials provide a basic understanding of the features offered in Enterprise Developer for Eclipse to develop and maintain both simple COBOL and mainframe subsystem applications.

Other tutorials, which are designed for Administrators, are available.

**Download the demonstration application**

A preconfigured, fully executing application, BankDemo, is available from the Micro Focus GitHub repository - [*click here*](https://github.com/MicroFocus/BankDemo). Download the sample's sources as follows:

1.  In the GitHub repository for the BankDemo demonstration, click **Releases** in the right-hand side part of the page.
2.  In the list of releases, locate and click the one that corresponds to the Enterprise Developer product release you have installed.
3.  Expand the **Assets** section, and click either **Source code (zip)** or **Source code (tar.gz)** to download the archive with the sample's sources.
4.  Expand the archive on your machine.

    The demonstration application includes all the source files needed to run it. The application is both a batch and online application which assesses data on a fictitious bank system. The bank data is stored in VSAM files.

![](images/080f42a3aadf5eea7bced48e38d755cd.png)**Important:** Before attempting this tutorial, create a directory on your machine for the sample files - for example, create a MFETDUSER directory on the root of your local drive (C:). Copy the entire contents from the expanded folder into the newly created directory. For example, you should have a **c:\\MFETDUSER\\datafiles** folder, etc.

As part of this tutorials, you use the supplied standard Eclipse COBOL project in the sample to set up a development environment for this application. The tutorials show how you can:

-   Create a project for your application
-   Edit the source files
-   Compile the source code
-   Execute and debug the application

 **Prerequisites**

You must have the following software installed:

-   Micro Focus Enterprise Developer for Eclipse. [*Click here*](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/enterprise-developer/) to access the product Help and the release notes of Enterprise Developer.
-   A TN3270 terminal emulator to run the CICS application. This tutorial uses Micro Focus Host Access for the Cloud (HACloud), which is installed with Enterprise Developer, but you may use an alternative terminal emulator. **Note:** A license for Micro Focus Rumba+ Desktop was included with Enterprise Developer product releases 8.0 and earlier, and can be used to run this tutorial.

**Using a remote enterprise server instance for the tutorials**

If you have an active firewall on the machine that is running your Directory Server and enterprise server instances, and you want remote clients to be able to connect to them, you must ensure that the firewall allows access to the ports that you are using.

For example, Directory Server is configured, by default, to use port 86. Your must configure your firewall to allow TCP and UDP access to this port. Similarly, the enterprise server instance you create as part of this tutorial, BANKDEMO, has listeners which use ports 9003 and 9023. For remote clients to be able to submit JCL jobs or connect a TN3270 terminal to these listeners, your firewall must permit access to these ports.

We recommend that, if you want remote users to access Enterprise Server functionality through the firewall, you use fixed port values so that you can control access via these.

## Starting the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

[Back to Top](#overview)

1.  To start the Eclipse IDE, click **Start \> All Programs \> Micro Focus Enterprise Developer \> Enterprise Developer for Eclipse** on Windows 10. 

    If you need instructions to get Enterprise Developer started on your local machine, see *To start Enterprise Developer* in the product Help for Enterprise Developer.

    This opens the **Eclipse Launcher** which enables you to choose a location for Eclipse to store your projects.

2.  For example, specify **C:\\MFETDUSER\\tutorial\\workspace** in the **Workspace** field, and click **Launch**.

    If this is the first time you start Enterprise Developer, you are presented with the Eclipse **Welcome page**. Click **Open Team Developer Perspective** to close the Welcome page and see the main Eclipse window.

    If the **Welcome page** is not opened, click **Window** \> **Perspective** \> **Open Perspective** \> **Other**, select the **Team Developer (default)**, and click **Open**.

    The views you see open in Eclipse and their layout depend on whether you have used Eclipse before. You can move, resize and minimize views which is why they might not look exactly as described here. If this is the first time you have used Eclipse, you should see the following views in the IDE, although most of the views are currently empty:

    ![](images/193c427ccb6cc1309873215dbef81d43.png)

    -   The Application Explorer view in the upper left part of the IDE gives a logical view of your applications. You are going to use the Application Explorer view most of the time. This tree view should already display an Enterprise Developer system entry. If not, right-click in this view, select **Add System(s)** and then select **ED System** and click **OK**. This view now displays a system entry used to support the standard Enterprise Developer projects. Expand this system entry and an application entry named **Enterprise Development Projects** is displayed. Right-click this application entry and select **Load Application**. If you are using this Eclipse workspace for the first time, there are no projects associated with this application.
    -   The Properties, Outline, and Program Outline tabbed views in the bottom left part of the IDE provide more information about selected tree or table entries, and outline information on various types in your sources when you start editing COBOL or PL/I programs or JCL.
    -   A series of tabbed views in the bottom right part of the IDE (Table Results view, Error Feedback view, Jobs view, File Mappings view, Console, Problems, Tasks) show for example sources in a table structure, the results of compiling and tasks.
    -   The IDE provides a Server Explorer view, where you can view the underlying execution environment. This view is displayed as a tab in the upper left part of the IDE.
    -   The Filter Definitions view in the upper right part of the IDE is used to manage search criteria within a loaded application.

    -   The Remote Systems view is used to connect to the mainframe system z/OS and provides access to all mainframe resources like MVS or USS files and MVS jobs. This view is displayed as a tab in the upper right part of the IDE.
    -   The main activity window in the top middle part of the IDE, the editor, is where you edit or debug the sources.
    -   Apart from the Eclipse menus, there are a number of buttons on the toolbar, which vary depending on what you are currently doing with Eclipse.
1.  Experiment with resizing, minimizing and restoring the views.
2.  If you close a view, click **Window** \> **Show View** \> **View Name** to restore it.
3.  At any time, you can reset the complete layout of the Team Developer Perspective to its default using **Window \> Perspective \> Reset Perspective**.

## Creating a Project and Adding the Source Files

[Back to Top](#overview)

You are going to use the project supplied with the BankDemo sample as a template to create a project for this demonstration. You will then add the source files to the projects to be able to build, develop and test the application.

The source files of the demonstration application are stored in subfolders named after the file type (for example, **bms**, **cobol**, **copybook**, **jcl**) in the **C:\\MFETDUSER\\sources** directory. The data files are in **C:\\MFETDUSER\\datafiles**.

**Creating the project for the Bankdemo application**

You use the Bankdemo project supplied with the sample to create your project in the Eclipse workspace that has the same settings as the sample project:

1.  In the Application Explorer view, right-click **Enterprise Development Projects**, which is the node for the standard application.
2.  Click **New COBOL Project \> COBOL Project from Template**.
    ![](images/13b0e3acb759b42320f73adb22983474.png)

3.  Click **Retrieve** next to **Template Path**.

    ![](images/2023b448364bdc76a9a0830175899e49.jpg)

4.  Browse to the **C:\\MFETDUSER\\tutorial\\projects\\Eclipse\\cobol\\Bankdemo** folder, and click **Select Folder**.
5.  Type Bankdemo in the project name field, and click **OK**.

    This creates a copy of the Bankdemo project in your Eclipse workspace and adds the project to the application in the Application Explorer view. If the Bankdemo project entry is not displayed in the tree view, refresh the **Enterprise Development Projects** entry.



1.  Expand the Bankdemo project in the Application Explorer view.

    ![](images/3306875a7cc8200841b4c6c316763222.jpg)

**The Bankdemo project**

Your project is pre-configured so that the build process creates the output files in a location that is used by the Enterprise Server logical server. To check which folder will include the built files:

1.  In the Application Explorer view, right-click the Bankdemo project, and click **Properties**.
2.  Expand **Micro Focus**, **Build Configurations**, and then click **Link**.

    The project comes with a predefined configuration called **loadlib**.

3.  Note that the **Output path** field points to the loadlib directory which will be created in the project directory at build time.
4.  You can cancel the project properties dialog box.

**Adding the demo source files**

In most cases, to add files to an Eclipse project, you use the **Import** command. This creates local copies of file sources in the workspace. Optionally, you can leave the source files in the original location and create links to them which is what you are going to do in this tutorial.

To add the sample's copybooks to the project:

1.  In Application Explorer view, right-click the **Bankdemo** project, and click **New** \> **Folder\> Folder**.
2.  Click **Advanced**, and check **Link to alternate location (Linked Folder)**.
3.  Browse to **C:\\MFETDUSER\\sources\\copybook**, and click **Select Folder**.
4.  Click **Finish**.

    This adds the folder storing the copybooks to your project as a linked resource.

    By default, Eclipse is set to build projects automatically (see **Project** \> **Build Automatically**), so it immediately compiles the files you have just added.

To add the other source files to the Bankdemo project:

1.  In Application Explorer view, right-click the **Bankdemo** project, and click **New** \> **Folder\> Folder**.
2.  Click **Advanced**, and check **Link to alternate location (Linked Folder)**.
3.  Browse to **C:\\MFETDUSER\\sources\\cobol**, and click **Select Folder**.
4.  Click **Finish**.

    This adds the folders storing the source files to your project as linked resources:

    ![](images/7429eb7409e9145a3aeb16a1df0a5b3c.png)

    Again, Eclipse immediately compiles the files you have just added.

    Check the **Console** and **Problems** views and see that some of the programs failed to compile. In the Application Explorer view, you can select a program and check the error and warning count property in the **Properties** view to indicate that there are compilation problems. The errors are due to the correct copybook paths not being specified in the project's properties.

5.  Repeat the steps above to add the files from the **C:\\MFETDUSER\\sources\\bms** and the **C:\\MFETDUSER\\sources\\jcl** folders as linked resources.

**Specifying the Copybook Paths for the Bankdemo Project**

Next, you need to specify the copybook paths for the project in order for the copybook dependencies to be resolved:

1.  In Application Explorer view, right-click the Bankdemo project, and click **Properties**.
2.  Expand **Micro Focus**, and then click **Build Path**.
3.  Click the **Dependency Paths** tab, and ensure **Type** is set to **COBOL Copybook Paths**.
4.  Enable the checkbox in front of **Bankdemo/copybook**.
5.  Click the **Build Precedence** tab, and click **Deselect All** in the right-hand side of the dialog box.

    You do not need to compile all source files for this demonstration so you only need to enable some of the folders on this page.

6.  Enable the checkboxes for the following folders:
    -   **Bankdemo/bms/cobol**
    -   **Bankdemo/cobol/core** 
    -   **Bankdemo/cobol/data/vsam**

7. Click **Apply and Close**. 

    Eclipse rebuilds the project. There are still a few issues that are reported.

**Setting Compiler Directives**

You now need to perform a scan of the COBOL programs in your project to determine and set the appropriate Compiler directives:

1.  Right-click the **Bankdemo** project, and click **Determine Directives**.

    The IDE performs a scan of the files and shows a report of which directives for dialect and for CICS must be set on the programs in your project in order for them to compile cleanly.

    ![](images/2795bd96591744946bf6d7eb80c8704e.jpg)

2.  Click **OK** to set the directives.

    If you are prompted to delete some user files, choose **No**.

    Setting the missing Compiler directives triggers a full rebuild of the project. The project should compile cleanly now.

**Adding Data Files**

The demonstration application includes a number of data files used. To see how you can edit data files, you only need to look at one of these files so you do not need to add a folder for it to the project. To add the data file to your project:

1.  In the Application Explorer view, right-click the Bankdemo project, and click **New** \> **File** \> **Other File**.
2.  Click **Advanced**, and check **Link to file in the file system**.
3.  Browse to the **C:\\MFETDUSER\\datafiles** folder.
4. Select **MFI01V.MFIDEMO.BNKACC.dat**, and then click **Open**.
5.  Click **Finish**.

    This adds the file to the Bankdemo project and also automatically opens it in the Micro Focus Data Files Tools utility. You can close the utility for now.

6.  Repeat steps 1 to 4 to add the **MFI01V.MFIDEMO.BNKACC.str** file to the project.

**Summary**

You created an Eclipse project and added references in it to the COBOL files, the copybooks, the BMS, and the JCL files of the demonstration program. Next, you are going to edit some of these source files.

## Editing Source Files

[Back to Top](#overview)

This topic describes the editing features for the various file types (COBOL, JCL, IMS, BMS, and data files).

**Important:** We recommend that you create backup copies of all files before you start editing them.



**Editing COBOL Files**

You are going to explore some of the COBOL editing features using the **ZBNKPRT1.cbl** program which produces a report from a sequential data file.

1.  In the Application Explorer view, double-click **ZBNKPRT1.cbl** in the **cobol/core** folder of the project.

    This opens the file in the COBOL editor in Eclipse. Next, you are going to enable the line numbers in the editor.

2.  Click **Window \> Preferences** to open the Eclipse preferences.
3.  Expand **General \> Editors**, and click **Text Editors**.
4.  Check **Show Line Numbers**, and click **Apply and Close**.

**Copybooks** 
    
Scroll down the file until you see some COPY statements. Click on line 58 for the COPY CTIMERD statement.

1. Press **F4** to open the file in COBOL Copy View, which shows the code of the copybooks expanded in source file.

   The COBOL Copy View is read-only and you cannot edit the code in it. The screen background chan from white to pale yellow.
1. Press **Ctrl+F4** to close the COBOL Copy View.
1.  To edit a copybook, position the cursor on the COPY statement and press **F3** (**Go To Definition**).
 
     This opens the copybook file in a new tab in the editor.

**Copybook Dependencies** 

By expanding a source file node in the Application Explorer view, you can see a list of all copybooks referenced in the source code, and nested within them any other copybooks referenced by those copybooks. Double-click a copybook to open it in the editor.

![](images/f7aea1f7a650338e844d566fbe894c8e.jpg)

Use the Copybook Dependency view to show where in the source file's structure the COPY statements appear, and which copybooks they reference. If the Copybook Dependency view is not displayed in the Team Developer perspective, to open this view click **Window \> Show View \> Other \> Micro Focus \> Copybook Dependency**.

![](images/e3aa258b24ae86229c1a4afc86334e5e.jpg)

Click a copybook reference in the Copybook Dependency view to locate the associated COPY statemen the appropriate line in the source code.

**Unused data**

Notice that some data items in the Data Division are crossed out. This is because they are not referenced in the Procedure Division.


**Program outline**

1. Right-click anywhere in the COBOL editor, and click **Quick Outline**. This opens a pop-up with the outline of the program similar to what the Outline view shows. 
2. Press **Ctrl+O** in the pop-up to see a more detailed outline similar to the Program Outline view. 
3. Double-click an item in the outline to see how the cursor positions itself on the line of code that this outline item refers to. 
4. Click on the permanent Outline view.


![](images/0a83561f1813ee83b9864c7ff1316134.jpg)

5.  Expand and collapse various lines in the Outline view.
6.  Double-click items in the Outline view to see how the cursor positions itself on the respective line of that each one of these outline items refers to and highlights the referenced item in the editor window

    
7. Click ![](images/76b30e98ec81ab51ddd71be8f2ab34c3.jpg) (**Sort**) in the **Outline** view to toggle between a physical or alphabetical sequence.

**Hyperlinks** 

1. In the editor, scroll down the file to a line in the Procedure Division.
2. Press and hold **Ctrl** and move your mouse around the code. This turns the data items and the paragraph names you hover over into hyperlinks.
![](images/ee28df1588527730d234f113d53f4745.png)
3. Click one of the hyperlinks to position the cursor on the definition of the respective data item or paragraph.                                                                             

**Viewing data definitions**

1. Hover over a data item in the Procedure Division to see information about the data item and how many times it is used in the program. 
2. Double-click a data item or paragraph name to see the IDE highlights all their occurrences in the code.

**Breadcrumbs**              
The ![](images/65bc336b21e1ecd824bc6e2a37508068.jpg) (**Toggle Context Breadcrumbs** icon) in the toolbar lets you see another view of the program showing the copybooks. 
1. Click the icon to enable breadcrumbs. This opens a new toolbar in the editor with the name of your COBOL program.
![](images/5eb45eefe2096c1cdabf92eb35c54ba1.jpg)

2. Click the arrow to the right of the program name to see a list of copybooks the program uses.
3. Click one of these copybooks to load it in a new tab in the editor.

**Marking text and block mode**

You can either use the mouse to mark a block of text or click ![](images/2a6ec092a713afe86e854b35e22548db.jpg) (**Toggle Block Selection Mode**) and select square blocks of text. When a selection is made, you can cut or copy it. 

**Rename** 

You can use rename refactoring to rename all occurrences of a variable:

1.  Scroll down to line 228 in the file.
2.  Cclick WS-EXEC-PARM-LL in the editor, right-click it, and click **Refactor \> Rename**.

    A pop-up is displayed prompting you to enter a new name for the variable.
    ![](images/2e15eb9d708cff50ce53b2564221fcf8.jpg)


3. Click the down arrow to show the context menu, and click **Open Rename Dialog**.
4. Specify WS-EXEC-PARM-NEW as a **New name** in the dialog box, and click **Preview**.

   This opens the **Rename COBOL Element** dialog box that enables you to preview and approve all changes.

5.  Click **Cancel** as you are not going to apply these changes for this demo.

    You can change your Eclipse preferences and rename without the **Rename COBOL Element** dialog box. To do this, go to **Window \> Preferences \> Micro Focus \> COBOL \> Editor**, and uncheck **Rename in editor without dialog**.


**Smart editing**

Next, we are going to look at the smart editing feature with background COBOL parsing. First you'll check the IDE preferences for suggestions that Content Assist offers you in the editor:

1.  Click **Window \> Preferences \> Micro Focus \> COBOL \> Editor \> Content Assist**.
2.  Check **Enable auto activation** then click **Apply and Close**.
3.  Scroll down to line 258 in the code and start typing the following, starting in area A of the code, one character at a time:
    
    ```
    MOVE W TO
    ```
    Notice how the words you type change in the editor. Once a word is recognized as a reserved word or a data item, its color changes. If a line of code contains invalid COBOL syntax, a red cross appears to the left of the line and the word is underlined with a wavy red line.

    Also, Content Assist automatically displays a pop-up with suggested keywords and names of data items appears as you type.

4.  Change the line to:
    ```
    MOVE 34 TO WS-
    ```
    If the IDE preferences for auto-activation of Content Assist have not been changed, Content Assist opens a list of potential data names that start with WS- to choose from. If Content Assist does not display a list, to open it manually click **Ctrl+Space**.

5. Finally, if you have changed this COBOL program, copy the backup version back in again.

**Renumbering the COBOL sources**

You can use the commands **Renumber** and **Unnumber** to insert and remove line numbers from your code. 

If your sources include any comments beyond column 73, you need to configure the line numbering in order to ensure you only apply changes to the COBOL sequence area. Here's how you can do this:                                                      |

1.  Click **Window \> Preferences \> Micro Focus \> COBOL \> Editor \> Line Numbering**.
2.  Ensure that only the **COBOL (left-hand margin)** option is enabled.
3.  Click **Apply and Close**.

To insert the line numbers in your code:

1.  Right-click the **ZBNKPRT1.cbl** file in the editor, and click **Source** \> **Renumber**.

    Alternatively, click ![](images/c71f72ff318550a468b3b5878582d585.jpg) in the Eclipse toolbar.

2.  Click **Yes** to confirm.

    This inserts line numbers in the COBOL sequence area.

    ![](images/d9179a486adab92c259bbcfee9ea82fb.jpg)

You can now remove the line numbers from your code:

1.  Right-click the **ZBNKPRT1.cbl** file in the editor, and click **Source** \> **Unnumber**. 

    Alternatively, click ![](images/eaac043737cf3683ab448f9500013cf5.jpg) in the Eclipse toolbar.
2.  Click **Yes** to confirm.

    This removes the line numbers from the COBOL sequence area.

To insert line numbers beyond the end of area B:

1.  In the IDE preferences for line numbering, check **Standard (right-hand margin)**.
2.  Click **Apply and Close**.
3.  Right-click the **ZBNKPRT1.cbl** file in the editor, and click **Source** \> **Renumber**.
4.  Click **Yes** to confirm.

    You should now see line numbers running down both sides of the source code:
    ![](images/3b21dc67bcfcfe86c33557f61a9df1d5.png)

5.  Click **Edit \> Undo Typing** as necessary to revert your changes to the file.

**JCL editing**

**1.** Double-click the **ZBNKSTMT.jcl** file in the Bankdemo project to open it in the associated editor.

The editor supports background parsing, syntax checking, content assist and an outline view like the COBOL Editor does.

![](images/79827921bedc1a53ada598f23aa23084.jpg)

**BMS editing**

There are two ways to edit BMS files. The first one is to use a BMS text editor available in the IDE. The other is to use a WYSIWYG version, the Micro Focus BMS Painter, which is available as a separate utility installed with this product.

To open the BMS file in the text editor inside Eclipse:

**1.** In the Application Explorer view, right-click **MBANK10.bms** in the **bms\\cobol** folder of your project, and click **Open With** \> **BMS Text Editor**.

Although you can use this basic text editor to make small changes, it is quite difficult to edit BMS files in text view.

A much more suitable and less error-prone way to edit BMS files is to use the BMS Painter.

1.  Close the BMS text editor.
2.  In the Application Explorer view, **right-click MBANK10.bms** in the **bms\\cobol** folder of your project, and click **Open With** \> **BMS Paint**.

    ![](images/ad53b86263c5a5de6c2f308fe5433ac3.png)This starts the external Micro Focus BMS Painter.

3.  In BMS Painter, you can click fields and move them by dragging.

    For example, double-click the data field immediately following the text “User Id”, and move it to a different position on the map.

4.  To add a field, click in the desired place in the window, and start typing.
5.  To change a field's properties, right-click it, and select **Properties**.
6.  To change the properties of the map or mapset, right-click the item, and select **Properties**.

    For example, do this for the MBANK10 mapset and the BANK10A map.

7.  Click **File** \> **Exit** to close the utility and do not save the file.

You can also explore your BMS maps and mapsets in the BMS Preview view:

1.  Make sure that **MBANK10.bms** is opened in the BMS text editor.
2.  Click ![](images/671083db9c345da1b32e928a8c5deac8.jpg) (**Toggle the BMS previewer view**) in the Eclipse toolbar to start the **BMS Preview** view.

![](images/32cea1fc29f1a87cf5b77477ac7d2668.png)

3.  In addition, you can open the **Outline** view to see the maps within the MBANK10 mapset.

    ![](images/a642f7b473306b2ecc7e9f191f68335c.jpg)

4.  Experiment by double-clicking on various fields in the BMS file in the text editor.

    Notice how the respective fields are highlighted in the **BMS Preview**, and in the **Outline** view.

    For more about the **BMS Preview** view, check your product Help.

**Editing data files**

Next, you can edit the data file using the Micro Focus Data Tools Editor:

1.  In the Application Explorer view, right-click the **.dat** file, and click **Open With** \> **Data File Tools**.

    This starts the **Data File Editor** and loads the **.dat** file in the **Open Data File** dialog box.

2.  Click **Open Exclusive** to load the file.
3.  **Data File Editor** loads the data file and shows two views:
    -   The left-hand pane shows the raw form of the file. Because many of the field are COMP-3 fields, the data in these fields is presented in an ASCII view.
    -   The right-hand pane shows the record layout for the file in its detailed field view and the COMP-3 fields are shown in a much better, editable form.

    ![](images/8c0d85bdc39b8b3345a5d25fe46699ac.png)

4.  Change the value of BAC-REC-BALANCE from 91.14 to 132.76 as follows: 

    a. Click the line for BAC-REC-BALANCE in the right pane, and then click ![](images/4fc0d64d1ee24b2a6869937b20ba5685.jpg), **Edit Record**.

    This highlights the record.

    b.  Double-click in the **Value** field for BAC-REC-BALANCE.
    
    c. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor inside the **Value** field. 

    d. Type 132.76 then click ![](images/d333b67a20f0bf3c03f1b166d0c952ab.jpg), **Save Record**.

    e. Confirm you want to save the changes to this record.
    
    f. Using the same method, restore the previous value of BAC-REC-BALANCE: 91.14. 
    
5. Close the Data File Tools utility.

## Compiling the Source Code

[Back to Top](#overview)

By default, the Eclipse IDE is set to build projects automatically. Whenever you add new COBOL or BMS files to the Bankdemo project, the IDE starts an automatic build (compilation).

**Important:** You need Enterprise Developer or Enterprise Developer for z Systems to create executables. Building projects is not supported in Enterprise Developer Connect.

To turn the automatic build off:

-   Click **Project** and disable **Build Automatically**.

To start a build manually:

-   Click **Project** \> **Build Project**.

The build in this case checks for any files that have changed and does two things:

-   Compiles any files affected by the changes
-   Relinks the built files if necessary 

Turn the automatic build on:
-   Click **Project** and enable **Build Automatically**.

**COBOL Compiler control**

The Micro Focus COBOL Compiler can compile many different COBOL dialect variations. It can also compile COBOL code that contains EXEC CICS or EXEC SQL statements. The Compiler is controlled through a series of "directives" which are passed to the Compiler at build time. You can set directives at either a project or component level.

Often the directives can be set only at the project level, which means that all component files in the project use them. Sometimes, you have a component which you need to compile with different directives. In this case, you can set the directives at the component level which overrides the project settings.

For example, most of the programs in your project could be using Enterprise COBOL for z/OS and only a few could use VS COBOL II. In this case, you would set directives for Enterprise COBOL for z/OS at the project level, and VS COBOL II at the respective COBOL programs.

The Bankdemo application already has the required Compiler directives set on the files. At build time, the IDE invokes the COBOL compiler to compile the sources and create a number of files. These "built" files can vary, but each COBOL program in the Bankdemo application compiles to produce the following three types of file:

| **File type**               | **Function**                                                             |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| .dll - dynamic link library | Effectively the executable module the Compiler creates for each program. |
| .idy - debugger information | The file created by the Compiler which allows debugging of the module.   |
| .obj - object file          | A temporary file the Compiler creates while producing the .dll file.     |

**BMS Compiler control**

In the same way as for COBOL, the BMS compilation is controlled both at project and at component level.

The BMS Compiler produces the following two types of file:

| **File type**         | **Function**                                                                                  |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| .mod - BMS executable | A file created by the BMS compiler which is the executable module relating to the BMS source. |
| .cpy - copybook       | A copybook that contains the BMS mapping for use in a COBOL program.                          |

**Producing a Compiler listing**

You can configure the IDE to create a fully expanded Compiler listing file during the build. The following is also an example of setting a directive at component level:

1.  In the Application Explorer view, right-click **ZBNKPRT1.cbl**, and click **Properties**.
2.  Click **COBOL** in the left-hand pane and check **Enable file specific settings**.
3.  Set **Generate listing file** to **Yes**, and then click **Apply and Close**.

During the build, the Compiler produces a source listing file, **ZBNKPRT1.lst**, in a Listing subfolder in the project directory (**C:\\MFETDUSER\\tutorial\\workspace\\Bankdemo\\Listing** in this case). The listing file includes a fully expanded source file together with some Compiler system information at the start and with any Compiler errors highlighted with asterisks.

You can view this listing from within the IDE: double-click the **.lst** file in the Listing folder of your project.

**Example of compiling a COBOL program with errors**

You can introduce some Compiler errors into one of the programs to see how the Compiler handles them:

1.  In the Application Explorer view, double-click **ZBNKPRT1.cbl**.
2.  Page down the program a few pages to the start of the Procedure Division around line 224.
3.  Introduce a few syntax errors as follows:

    - On line 226 change RUN-TIME to RUN-TME

    - On line 229 change SPACES to SPOCES

    - On line 237 place a period after the END-IF

    - Move one of the copybooks, **CTIMERD.cpy**, from the copybook folder to the **jcl** folder - right-click the file in Application Exlorer, click **Move**, select the folder to move this to, and click **OK**.

    This triggers a build of the project which will also update the listing file. The messages in the **Console** view indicate that there are build errors.

    The errors are underlined with red wavy lines and a colored bar is added to the left of each line that includes an error.

4.  Hover over an underlined item to view a pop-up with an explanation of what the error is.
5.  Save the program.
6.  Click the **Problems** tab to view the list of errors.

    If it is hidden you can open it by clicking **Window** \> **Show View** \> **Problems**.

    **Tip:** Click the column headings to sort the list into an appropriate order; for example, click the **Program** heading to order the errors by program.

7.  Double-click an error in the list to position the cursor on the line of code that contains the error.
8.  To fix the copybook error:
    
    a.  Locate the error related to the unknown copybook in the **Problems** view.

    b.  Right-click the line for the error, then select **Quick Fix**.

     The Quick Fix window appears.

    c.  Select **Enable copybook path...**, then click **OK**.

       This displays a message that the directory containing the copybook is not on the copybook path for the project.

    d.  Click **Yes** to add the **Bankdemo/jcl** folder where you moved the copybook to the copybook path of the project.

    This triggers a rebuild of the project which now compiles cleanly as it now locates the copybook.

9.  Check the errors in the listing file, **ZBNKPRT.lst**, as follows:
    1.  Double-click the .lst file in the **Listing** folder.

        The lines that include syntax errors are marked with asterisks (\*\*).
        ![](images/d088a3026590cf9c0ea87f816326877d.png)

10. In the IDE, fix the errors in **ZBNKPRT.cbl**, and save the file.

    There should be no errors in the build now.

**Note:** Move the copybook back to its original directory in case other projects are expecting to locate it there.

## Unit Testing the Batch Application

[Back to Top](#overview)

The first thing you need to do is check that the Bankdemo application is executing correctly.

To execute the JCL, you need to run the application in an instance of the Micro Focus Enterprise Server (sometimes abbreviated to Enterprise Server). This demonstration includes a pre-configured enterprise server instance called BANKDEMO which you need to import in Enterprise Server and start before you execute the Bankdemo application.

**Important:** You need Enterprise Developer or Enterprise Developer for z Systems to execute the application as running applications is not supported in Enterprise Developer Connect.

Before you proceed, ensure that the default settings are applied to the Directory Sever:

1.  Click the Start menu and open the Services application. Navigate to Micro Focus Directory Server to view its status and set it to **Running** if it is not already started.

2.  In Eclipse, click the Server Explorer view.

   If the window is not visible, click **Window** \> **Show View** \> **Other**, then expand **Micro Focus**, click **Server Explorer**, and click **Open**.

3.  Click **Default [127.0.0.1:86]** and in the Properties pane, check the value of the directory server field. If it does not say Default, right-click the value and select **Restore Default Value**.

**Importing the Bankdemo server**

This sample provides a PowerShell script that creates the region definition to use in this tutorial:

1.  Open File Explorer, and navigate to the **C:\\MFETDUSER\\tutorial** folder.
2.  Right-click **createdefinition.ps1**, and click **Run with PowerShell**. Allow the script to execute, and specify **A** to allow the execution policies.

    This executes the script and creates the Enterprise Server region definition file, **BANKDEMO.xml**, in the same folder. The file is configured for the location in which you saved the sample files.

Now you can import the definition of the BANKDEMO logical server (LSER) in Enterprise Server:

1.  In Eclipse, click the Server Explorer view.
2.  Right-click **Default [127.0.0.1:86]**, and click **Import Server**.
3.  In the **Import Server** dialog box, click **Browse** for **Import file**.
4.  Set the file extension field to **.xml**.
5.  Browse to the **C:\\MFETDUSER\\tutorial** folder, select **BANKDEMO.xml**, click **Open**, and then click **Finish**.

    Check the **Console** view for the results of importing the server. The Server Explorer window should now show a server called BANKDEMO under **Default [127.0.0.1:86]**. If the server is not visible, right-click **Default [127.0.0.1:86]**, and click **Refresh**.

    ![](images/94b448624765e5e546bb4b4851b5b56e.jpg)

**Associate the BANKDEMO Enterprise Server with your project**

You need to associate your application with the BANKDEMO server. This ensures that the project's **loadlib** directory is used by the BANKDEMO enterprise server. BANKDEMO is configured to use the \$IDE_LOADLIB environment variable as the first location in the search path and, when the IDE starts the server, then \$IDE_LOADLIB is set to the output directories of any project associated with the server.

1. Right-click the BANKDEMO server, point to **Associate with project**, then click **Bankdemo**.

   ![](images/8fa1cc05cf3c9081809c785e2c53ce42.jpg)

**Configure the IDE settings for Enterprise Server**

Configure the IDE to start the associated BANKDEMO server automatically as follows:

1.  Click **Window** \> **Preferences**.
2.  Expand **Micro Focus**, and click **Enterprise Server**.
3.  Set the following options on this page to **Always** in order to enable the IDE to start or stop the associated server, and to enable dynamic debugging, for when it is not enabled in the server:

    - **Automatically start the associated server** - this ensures the IDE will start the server if it is not running when you execute the application.

    - **Automatically stop servers started by Eclipse when closing Eclipse** - this enables the IDE to stop servers when you close Eclipse.

    - **Automatically enable dynamic debugging** - this ensures the IDE will check whether the server has dynamic debugging enabled and, if it is not, will enable it when you start debugging.

4.  Click **Apply and Close**.

**Starting the BANKDEMO Enterprise Server and Showing the Server Log**

These are the steps to start the server manually, and are included for completeness. You do not have to start the server manually, as you have configured the IDE to start the server automatically.

1.  In Server Explorer, right-click **BANKDEMO**, then click **Start**.

    **Note:** You might receive an **ESMAC Sign On** dialog prompting you to provide connection details for the BANKDEMO server. This is a standard security dialog. Click **OK** without specifying any sign on details. Also, you may skip enabling password recovery.

    You might also receive a **Windows Security Alert** blocking the **MF Communications** process. Click **Allow access**.

    You can check the **Console** view to ensure that the BANKDEMO server has started successfully.

2.  Right-click the BANKDEMO server in Server Explorer, and click **Show Console Log**.

    Check the **Console** view as it now shows the messages from the server log:

    ![](images/72788a8d3fefa8cdffb247ca5f0a8484.jpg)

3.  Right-click the BANKDEMO server again, and then click **Refresh** to see that the server has started.

    You are now ready to execute the JCL job.

**Executing JCL**

The JCL provided in your demo causes the COBOL application to read a file, sort the data and produce a report. The JCL file, **ZBNKSTMT.jcl**, is in the **Sources \> jcl** folder of the project. To submit this job:

1.  In the Application Explorer view, expand the**jcl** folder.
2.  Right-click **ZBNKSTMT.jcl**, and click **Submit JCL to associated Server**.

    **Note:** If you have not started the BANKDEMO server yet, since you configured the IDE to start the server automatically, you receive a notification that the server will be started. Click **Yes** to confirm this.

    Check the **Console** view to see that this job has been submitted.
    ![](images/360193e8c0b763602d6a913d9c84609d.png)

3.  Click one of the links to show the spool details for the job.

**Viewing the Catalog and the Spool**

You can open the catalog and the spool directly from Server Explorer.

To view the catalog:

1.  In Server Explorer, right-click the BANKDEMO server, and click **Show Catalog**.

    This opens the catalog:

    ![](images/573690afdd1e2e9b47768c4eacf8771e.jpg)

2.  Expand the **Display** section for the catalog item to preview the contents of the file.

To view the spool:

1.  In Server Explorer, right-click the BANKDEMO server, and click **Show Spool**.
2.  Double-click on the name of one of the jobs in the list to open the details in a new tab.
![](images/ea36d8374884cc2250e25160fa077a34.png)
3.  Details of the job are displayed in their own appropriate sections; expand these sections to view the details.
![](images/2fa4e0ba0e3925ed4279c4c8a995af04.jpg)

    In the **DD Entries** section, there are:

    -   Two **SYSOUT** results (one for the EXTRACT and one for the SORT). Click these and see the **SYSOUT Details** section:
    -   The **PRINTOUT** is the final printed results created by your job. Click **PRINTOUT** in the **DD Entries** section to see the results:
    ![](images/1f0ec6c73989be4497cb4346c9d4a7b8.png)

You can now start to look at how to run the online application.

## Unit Testing the Online Application

[Back to Top](#overview)

In the previous step, Unit Testing the Batch Application, you used the BANKDEMO enterprise server. You are going to use it again for online testing.

As with JCL, execution of the jobs requires a previously configured Micro Focus enterprise server.

**Important:** You need Enterprise Developer or Enterprise Developer for z Systems to execute the application as running applications is not supported in Enterprise Developer Connect.

Before you proceed, ensure that Micro Focus Host Access for the Cloud (HACloud) is running:

1. Go the the Start menu and open the Services application.

2. Navigate to the Micro Focus HA Cloud service and check that its status is set to **Running**.

3. If it is not running, right-click and click **Start**.

**Executing the CICS application**

The CICS application requires that you use a 3270 terminal emulator. This tutorial uses Micro Focus Host Access for the Cloud (HACloud), but you may adapt the tutorial to suit your terminal emulator of choice. 

**Configuring the TN3270 settings in the IDE**

To check the IDE preferences for the TN3270 emulator:

1.  In the IDE, click **Window \> Preferences**.
2.  Expand **Micro Focus \> Enterprise Server**, and click **TN3270**.
3.  Ensure that **Enable display**, **Host Access for the Cloud** and **Connect automatically** are all selected.
4.  Click **Apply and Close**.

**Starting the terminal emulator**

1.  Right-click the BANKDEMO server in Server Explorer, and click **Show TN3270 Display**.

    This opens **Host Access for the Cloud** in your default browser and automatically establishes a 3270 terminal connection to the BANKDEMO server. You can see the starting page of the ES/MTO region BANKDEMO.

**Executing the Enterprise Server Demonstration**

1.  Type your logon details, and press **Enter**.

    A suitable **User Id** is b0001. You can type anything as a **Password** - the field must not be empty though.

    ![](images/Bankdemo_001.png)

2.  Type / against **Display your account balances** and press **Enter** to see the details for this customer.

    ![](images/Bankdemo_002.png)

    ![](images/Bankdemo_003.png)

3.  You can explore this application further if you wish or press **Ctrl + F2** to clear the screen and conclude the session.

If HACloud disconnects from the server, you can connect again manually as follows:

1.  Click **Open Session**, ![](images/HAC_OpenSessionbutton.png), in the toolbar of the HACloud window.
2.  In the **Available Sessions** dialog box, click on the BANKDEMO server.    

    This connects the display to the BANKDEMO server and loads the start screen of the application.

3.  Follow the steps described earlier in this topic to execute the application in the HACloud view.

**Stopping the enterprise server**

You can stop the BANKDEMO server from within Server Explorer. You can leave it running though, if you wish to continue this tutorial.

**Note:** In production, enterprise servers are long-running processes that are usually run for many months without stopping and starting.

## Debugging the Batch Application

[Back to Top](#overview)

You are going to debug the batch Bankdemo application.

**Important:** You need Enterprise Developer or Enterprise Developer for z Systems to debug applications as this feature is not supported in Enterprise Developer Connect.

**Starting the server**

If the enterprise server is not yet started, you need to start it as follows:

1.  Open the **Server Explorer** view.

    If the view is not visible, click **Window** \> **Show View** \> **Other**. Select **Micro Focus** \> **Server Explorer** and then click **OK**.

2.  In Server Explorer, right-click the BANKDEMO server, and then click **Start**.

    Wait until the server has started. If, in the list of servers in Server Explorer, BANKDEMO still has a red square next to it, this is a refresh delay.

**Viewing the debug configurations**

The project has two pre-configured debug configurations; a CICS Debug and a JCL Debug one, that you will use to debug the batch and the online application.

1.  In the Application Explorer view, select the BANKDEMO project, and then click **Run** \> **Debug Configurations**.
2.  In the left-hand pane of the **Debug Configurations** dialog box, expand **COBOL Enterprise Server**.
3.  Click **CICS Debug**.
4.  Click the different tabs in the right-hand pane to see what debug settings are enabled for this configuration. Note that this configuration will be used with the BANKDEMO server.
5.  Click **JCL Debug** under **COBOL Enterprise Server**.
6.  Click the different tabs in the right-hand pane to see what debug settings are enabled for this configuration.
7.  Click **Close** to close the **Debug Configurations** dialog box without saving any changes.

**Starting the debugger**

You can now start the debugger. It starts in the background until a program which is debuggable is triggered. To start the debugger:

1.  In the Application Explorer view, select the BANKDEMO project, and then select **Run** \> **Debug Configurations** from the menu bar.
2.  In the left-hand pane of the Debug Configurations dialog expand **COBOL Enterprise Server**.
3.  Click **JCL Debug**, and then click **Debug**.
4.  You might receive a message about opening the Debug perspective when it launches. If you do, click **Yes**.

    This opens a new **Debug** view, showing that the Micro Focus Debugger is waiting for attachment.

    In addition, in the top right of the main screen, the view has changed from **Team Developer** to **Debug**:

    ![](images/88f58bfeb3fd128cb2fe55172b59806e.jpg)

    Click the respective icon to switch between the two perspectives.

5.  Click the **Team Developer** icon for now.
6.  In Server Explorer, right-click the BANKDEMO enterprise server, and click **Refresh**.

    The application is now waiting for an event that will trigger debugging.

**Simple debugging**

You are going to look at some simple features inside the debugger. Start by submitting the JCL job:

1.  In the Application Explorer view, expand the **jcl** folder in your project.
2.  Right-click **ZBNKSTMT.jcl**, and click **Submit JCL to associated Server**.
3.  Depending on what you have done before, you may receive a message to **Confirm Perspective Switch**. If you receive it, check **Remember my decision**, and click **Yes**. If Eclipse does not switch to

    the Debug perspective automatically, click the **Debug** button, ![](images/88f58bfeb3fd128cb2fe55172b59806e.jpg), in the right upper corner of the main Eclipse window to switch the perspective.

    This starts the debugger and opens ZBNKEXT1.cbl for debugging, with the execution point set on the first line of Procedure Division.

    ![](images/70f9ebaf905466c7d4585f32d7e5913b.jpg)

If you need to display the line numbers in the editor:

• Right-click in the left-most gray area of the editor, and click **Show Line Numbers**.

**Stepping through the code**

The highlighted line of code is the one the IDE will execute next.

1.  Press **F5** to execute the line.

    The PERFORM statement executes and takes you to the line starting with IF TIMER. You can also see that a Variables view is now open in the IDE showing the current value of a data item on the line of code which is about to be executed.

2.  Press **F5** slowly a few more times until you reach line 574. Watch the code as you step through it and notice how the values of the variables change inside the Variables view.

    ![](images/e17c83ba64e31c1ddeb3848a76aade4f.jpg)

**Looking at data values**

1.  Scroll to line 283 of **ZBNKEXT1.cbl**.
2.  Hover the WS-RECORD-COUNTER2 data item.

    This provides you with details of the location, the size, the format, the number of times the field is used in the program, and the current value of the data item.

    ![](images/7351c4d4d9690e58c504d4ce5d856223.jpg)

3.  To change the value of WS-RECORD-COUNTER2, click the data item in the editor, right-click it, and click **Inspect item**.

    This opens a pop-up window showing the value of the data item.

    ![](images/a93da4780da751b597e371bcc4ff39b2.jpg)

4.  Click **Add to Expressions View** in the pop-up.

    This opens the **Expressions** tabbed view and adds the data item to it.

5.  On the row for WS-RECORD-COUNTER2, click the arrow next to the data item to expand it.
6.  In the repeated version of the field name, change the value from 00000 to 00006.

    ![](images/2ad7c25103bcd3d34a316191e14a7ef7.jpg)

    The new value is used from this point.

**Running CSI queries**

You can use the COBOL Source Information (CSI) functionality and its **Quick Browse** dialog to obtain information about your program when you are debugging it. This example shows details for data items starting WS-, such as the name, definition, and amount of times each item occurs in the program.

1.  Click the **Quick Browse** button (![](images/6380a28bfad2e4cf713e31a148af5a87.png)) on the toolbar to start the **Quick Browse** dialog box.
2.  Enter a simple query such as WS-\*.

    ![](images/35218b26fdce3807aec247d09bf805e5.jpg)

3.  Click **OK** to run the query.

    The results are shown in the **Search** view.

    ![](images/7e3e6caec41336fa960b8b29bb013e99.jpg)

    To see more examples of CSI queries, start the Quick Browse dialog box again, and press **F1** to open the product help.

**Setting a simple breakpoint**

Check the Breakpoints view at the top right of the screen. Currently, there are no breakpoints set in the program. To set a simple breakpoint:

1.  Scroll down the code to line 171.
2.  Double-click in the grey area to the left of this line or right-click in the same place, and click **Toggle Breakpoint**.

    ![](images/878abd2c21b3ea7a1828d0ce903ac9ad.jpg)

3.  Do the same for line 177.
    
    **Note:** You can enable and disable the breakpoints from the Breakpoints view. 

    ![](images/c622b0c8fb53f7265723f1771fc53504.jpg)

4.  Use **F5** to step through the code and **F8** to execute it. Press **F8** now.

    The execution of the code stops at the first breakpoint.

5.  Press **F8** to resume the execution.

    You can see that **ZBNKEXT1.cbl** finishes and the debugger starts to debug the second program defined in the JCL.

    This program executes to completion and the job completes.

**Stop debugging**

Although the job has completed, the debugger is still waiting for the next event. To stop debugging:

1.  Click **Run** \> **Terminate** or click the terminate button, ![](images/TerminateDebugging.png), in the debugger toolbar.
![](images/8f716087b654affcf7d7ebebb47da828.jpg)
2.  Finally, switch back to the Team Developer Perspective.

## Debugging the Online Application

[Back to Top](#overview)

**Important:** You need Enterprise Developer or Enterprise Developer for z Systems to debug applications as this feature is not supported in Enterprise Developer Connect.

**Starting the server**

If the enterprise server is not yet started, you should start it as follows:

1.  Click the Server Explorer tab in the bottom right pane of the IDE.

    If the tab is not visible, click **Window** \> **Show View** \> **Other**. Select **Micro Focus COBOL \> Server Explorer** and then click **OK**.

2.  In Server Explorer, right-click the BANKDEMO server, and then click **Start**.

    Wait until the server has started. If in the list of servers in Server Explorer BANKDEMO still has a red square next to it, right-click it, and click **Refresh**.

**Starting the debugger**

You can now start the debugger. It starts in the background until a program which is debuggable is triggered. 

To start the debugger:
