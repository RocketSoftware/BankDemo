         TITLE 'Two" complement routine'
***********************************************************************
* This routine will be used to obtaim the "two's complement" of a     *
* string. This is particularly useful in files/databases that cannot  *
* sort, as in SQL with the ORDER BY option. Most methods give a read  *
* forward by key, but not backwards. By using the 2's compliment, we  *
* are effectively reading backwards.                                  *
*---------------------------------------------------------------------*
* This routine will be passed 3 parameters:                           *
* - a two byte binary field containing the length of the field to     *
*   be processed (min of 1, max of 256)                               *
* - the input string area                                             *
* - the output string area                                            *
